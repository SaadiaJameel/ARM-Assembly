## ARM-Assembly

The study and learning of ARM assembly was done under several sections as part of the 2nd year labs. 

Behavioural modeling and gate level modeling were practiced first. Thereafter, concepts such as branching and conditions, function calls and return, memory and data were all programmed in ARM, using mailnly behavioural modeling.
